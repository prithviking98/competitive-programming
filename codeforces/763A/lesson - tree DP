1) always use adjacency list to store tree

2) dynamic prograpping doesn't necessarily mean memoisation needs to be done in an array

3) for a tree of n nodes, n-1 edges are there
corresponding to each edge, there are two possible subtrees - one each for when either of the connected
nodes becomes the parent. So the number of total possible different subtrees is 2(n-1) when you're considering
any node can be the root. (entire tree is not considered as subtree here, if that is also counted, there are 
n additional subtrees for each of the n nodes becoming the root)

4) unless explicitly stated, edges given in problems are undirected and graphs given in problems are not 
 guaranteed to be trees
