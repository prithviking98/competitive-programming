The acquire_1056bytes program usage has changed. The new usage is as follows:

Usage:
./acquire_1056bytes -d <dev_name> -f <num_files> -m <acq_mode>
<dev_name>  : 'eth0' or 'eth1'
<num_files> : 1 to 200
<acq_mode>  : 0 (observation - file names are formatted) or 1 (test - file
              names are not formatted)

Getting help:
./acquire_1056 -h

Examples:
./acquire_1056bytes
    This is the default - device name is 'eth0', number of files is 1, and
    acquisition mode is 0. The file name would be of the form
    'chXX-<pulsar_name>_<date>_<time>.mbr'.

./acquire_1056bytes -d eth0 -f 1 -m 0
    Same as the default usage.

./acquire_1056bytes -f 2 -m 1
    Writes 2 files with names 'packet0' and 'packet1'.
