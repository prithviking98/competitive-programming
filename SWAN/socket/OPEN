1. The parser crash problem - When the command sender is waiting for return info
   packets (<das-id> is 0) from the mcd (this happens when any DAS machine is
   down, and the mcd waits for the return infos until timeout), and a CTRL+C is
   given to it, the parser crashes
2. The pidfile mechanism is not working with the start-stop-daemon
3. mbrmcd does not use host names, only IP addresses
4. Consider rethinking error codes
